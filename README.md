## Hello World!

As a webDev, how could I not build _my own portfolio_ website? That would be crazy!
This repo is a demo in itself. I integrated a bunch of technologies just to prove that I can.

Here's a list:

-   **[React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** for a cool PWA feel
-   FakerJS to get mock data during development
    -   this was fun

Fun fact, there is a `JSON.statham()` being used to enhance the power
of JavaScript objects. If the object is not strong enough, however, it may get killed. Use with caution!

This is a note. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

```bash
npm install
npm start
function add(num, char){
return num + char;
}
```

function add(num, char) {
	return num + char;
