## Hello World!

As a webDev, how could I not build _my own portfolio_ website? That would be crazy!

This repo is a demo in itself. I integrated several technologies just for experimentation.

Here are some of them:
-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - because SPAs and PWAs are the future of the internet
-   **[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)** - trying out modern state management tools
-   **[FakerJS](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)** - to get mock data during development
-   **[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)** - easily manage website content

###### FUN FACT
There is a `JSON.statham()` being used to enhance the power
of JavaScript objects. If the object is not strong enough, however, it may get killed. Use with caution!
